# algorithms & data structures
ToDo's and open points: 
- Review and refactor folder "linked_lists" and compare to "data_structures/source/linked_lists"
- systematic on backtracking problems?
- systematic on dynamic programming problems?
- All kinds of caches are missing (only LRU data_structures/source/stacks_and_queues/lru_cache.h)
- Graph algorithms
