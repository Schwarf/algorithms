- Algo 'can_reach_last_index' can be solved with DP but is actually solved with greedy algorithm here. Move it.
- The knapsack problem is only solved for integral weight types. Floating point ones must be treated separately?
- Top-Down approach to longest_ideal_string_subsequence is buggy and untested.
- Understand trees, subproblem graphs and topological sort in the context of dynamic programming.
