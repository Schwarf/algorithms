- Algo 'can_reach_last_index' can be solved with DP but is actually solved with greedy algorithm here. Move it.
- The unit test /media/linux_data/projects/cpp/algorithms/dynamic_programming/test/test_longest_string_chain.cpp:45: FAILs
- The knapsack problem is only solved for integral weight types. Floating point ones must be treated separately?
- Top-Down approach to longest_ideal_string_subsequence is buggy and untested.
