ToDo:

- Write helper functions for tests to automate generation of binary trees (binary trees)
- Write unit tests for maximum product of splitted tree (binary trees)
- Write unit tests for maximum path sum
- Write unit tests for find_mode_in_binary_tree.
- Study optimal algorithm for find_mode_in_binary_tree: Morris traversal.
- Study segment trees in more detail and extend unit tests.
- Implement algo to check if tree is symmetric, a mirror of itself
- Implement algo to compute sum of binary tree of the digits from root-to-each-leaf-node
