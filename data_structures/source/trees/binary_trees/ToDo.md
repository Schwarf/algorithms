ToDo:

- Write helper functions for tests to automate generation of binary trees (binary trees)
- Write unit tests for maximum product of splitted tree (binary trees)
- Study optimal algorithm for find_mode_in_binary_tree: Morris traversal.
- Write unit tests for count_nodes_equal_to_average_of_subtree.
- Study segment trees in more detail and extend unit tests.
- Implement algo to check if tree is symmetric, a mirror of itself
- Implement algo to compute sum of binary tree of the digits from root-to-each-leaf-node
- Add more unit tests for insert_tow_into_tree
- Add more unit tests to construct_binary_tree_from_inorder_and_postorder.h
- Add more unit tests to construct_binary_tree_from_preorder_and_inorder.h
- Implement CORRECT iterative solution for delete_nodes_return_forest.h
