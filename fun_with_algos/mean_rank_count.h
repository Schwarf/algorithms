// There is a scholaship test on an education platform.
// There are n students with roll numbers 1, 2, ..., n who appeared for the test, where the rank secured by
// the ith student is denoted by rank[i]. Thus, the array rank is a permutation of length n .
// Groups can only be formed with students having consecutive roll numbers, in other words, a subarray of the
// original array. For each value x (1 <= x <= n), find the number of groups that can be formed such that
// they have a mean rank equal to x.
//
// More formally, given a permutaion of length n, find the number of subarrays of the given array having a mean
// value equal to x , for each x in the range [1, n] .
//
// Notes
//
//    The mean value of an array of k elements is defined as the sum of elements divided by k.
//    A permutation of leangth n is a sequence where each number from q to n appears exactly once.
//    A subarray of an array is a contiguous section of the array.
