ToDo:

* Finish implementation and tests for:
  * find_review_score
* Algorithms to study/implement:
    * Task-scheduler with each task takes a certain amount ofb time and has a idle-time until next tasks of same
      "kind" can be scheduled. Get inspired from OS, database systems, networking, distributes systems, cloud systems.
    * Write unit tests for "spider_brainteaser" and "find_original_array_from_doubled_array."
* Sort all algos (not only in this project) and separate them into categories e.g. greedy, etc.
* Tests for logger rate are commented out because they fail
*
